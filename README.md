# Final Prep

The goal of this repo is to provide students with some things to think about in preparation for the final exam. This repo contains two files. Final.Rmd which is an example final (not the actual final) and will use data/examples from our class which are similar to what will be on the final. The file, final-answer.rmd has, surprise, the answers.
